                   <p>This is my first offical random password generator using Javascript code. Once you access the site you are first able to choose how many characters to choose your password between 8 to 128 characters. The following steps are whether you would like to include numbers, special characters, lowercase, and uppercase charaters as well. Once you entered and clicked through these requirements, you're then able to copy your randomly generated password.</p>

                <p>A web app that brings betting information on European Football (Premiere League) to an American audience.

                <br>
                  As a European soccer fan, when I search for a match I expect to see statistics, current rankings, highlights, as well as money props. Having access to this information would then help organize and familiarize myself in order to place the most successful wager.
