This portfolio exemplfies my progression through learning and 
producing code as a Front-End Web Developer. 

Based on the objectives this homework entailed, I looked back at similar code that we worked with 
as a class which would be able to produce either the formate, navigation, or design that this
homework requested. From there I analyzed and planned the following steps I needed to take to alter and 
personalize the code to what was able to clearly impict me, as an aspring Web Developer. 

This is a project that I will consistently work on over time as I perfect my craft. Hope in the near 
future I will be able to create a page that I am proud of to show
to future employers.
